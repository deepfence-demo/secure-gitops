## Secure GitOps
This demo illustrates Secure GitOps practices by incorporating GitHub Actions and [Deepfence ThreatMapper](https://github.com/deepfence/ThreatMapper) vulnerability scanning for Continuous Integration (CI) and [WeaveWorks Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux) for Continuous Delivery (CD).
